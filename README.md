# Shoe Task


You and your friends have deciede to start excersiing together every week. But before you could even get started the discussion about what shoes are the best surfaced. As your friend knows that you know computer they asked you to create a program that could help tarack of different pairs of shoes.


## Create the program according to the following requirements:

1. Create a base class called Shoe that stores the brand of the shoe as a String and the size of the shoe as a double. Crate a constructor that takes two parameters, the brand and the size. Make the instance variables public and final.


2. Create One subclass to Shoe that is called Walking, this subclass shall have a boolean instance variable called goretex. The constructor shall set the goreTex variable from a paramerter value. The instance variable shall be declared public and final. The constructor shall also take the parameters necessary to call the constructor of the superclass.


3. Create a second subclass to Shoe called Runnin. This class shall work exactly like the Walking subclass but the instance variable shall be named weight and be a double


4. Create three pair of shoes in the main method, two pairs of walking shoes and one pair fo running shoes. Make sure the objects store the following data:


        brand       size     Gore-Tex        Weight

        Nike        43                      250
        Hanwag      43.5        yes     
        Marrell     42          No






5. Store the three Objects in an array


6. Use a loop and the array to print all the information about the three pair of shoes without using a toString mthod. The information shall be printed using the following format

        Nike size43,5 250gram
        hanweg size 43.5 gore-tex
        marwell size 42.0 gore-tex
